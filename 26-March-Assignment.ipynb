    "    Ans: Simple linear regression is a statistical method that examines the relationship between two continuous variables. \n",
    "         It involves one independent variable and one dependent variable, and aims to find a linear relationship between them. \n",
    "         An example of simple linear regression is analyzing the relationship between a person's height and weight.\n",
    "         Multiple linear regression, involves examining the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. \n",
    "         It aims to find a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. \n",
    "         An example of multiple linear regression is analyzing the relationship between a person's salary and their level of education, years of experience, and age."

    "         the variance of the residuals is constant across the range of the independent variable, and there is no multicollinearity among independent variables. \n",
